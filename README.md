ScheduleToIpe
=============

Java GUI program to schedule tasks and output this to an Ipe-interpretable file.


Usage
-----

Download the JAR file and the res-folder and make sure you save those in the same folder. Thus, the structure has to be as follows:

    /path/to/some/dir/ :
      ScheduleToIpe.jar
      res/
        ipe_header.txt
        ipe_footer.txt

Then, simply run the JAR file. When exporting a schedule from the GUI, it will be saved as "out.ipe" in your home directory.
